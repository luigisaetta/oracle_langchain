Data Handling in Generative AI
Here are common questions about how Generative AI handles user data.
- Does the Generative AI service retain customer-provided training data used to fine-tune a custom model?
-
No. The customer stores and manages their training data in their own customer tenancy (commonly inside an OCI Object Storage bucket). The Generative AI's fine-tuning job uses this training data to train a custom model for customer. Generative AI service does not persist this training data beyond the duration of this training job. This training data is solely used for building a custom model for this customer. The custom model is also a resource that's managed by the customer. This training data is not used to improve the general use cases for the Generative AI service.
- Does the Generative AI service retain the customer provided prompts and inputs used for inferencing, on the Large Language Models (LLMs)?
- No, the Generative AI service does not retain customer inputs. A user's input on an inference call is sent to the LLM and a response is generated by the LLM that's returned to the user. Both input and output are not stored inside the Generative AI service.
- Does Generative AI share the prompts and responses with the third-party model providers such as Cohere or Meta?
- No.
- Does Generative AI share the fine-tuning training data with third-party model providers such as Cohere or Meta?
- No. Generative AI does not share any training data with the model providers.
- Does Generative AI share a customer's fine-tuned custom model with or give the fine-tuned custom model to third-party model providers?
- No. Generative AI service does not share custom models with third-party model providers.
- Is the training data encrypted?
-
The data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. The training data is deleted from fine-tuning cluster as soon as the training job is completed.
Training data for fine-tuning the model is always double encrypted, by default, by Oracle-managed AES-256 encryption and optionally by customer-managed private keys through OCI Vault service. Customers can delete the data at any time.
Oracle encrypts all the data in motion with TLS 1.2
