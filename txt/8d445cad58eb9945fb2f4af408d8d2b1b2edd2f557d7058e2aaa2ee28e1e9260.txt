Getting Started with Oracle Linux
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has a set of Oracle Linux platform images that you can select when creating an instance. For more information about specific releases of platform images, see Release Information.
Key features for Oracle Linux on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
Oracle Linux images available on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure include:
The advantages of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Oracle Linux images over traditional Oracle Linux deployments are:
-
Instances automatically have access to Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN) content.
-
If the instance is connected to a service gateway, it has access to ULN content through the regional yum servers. Unlike the publicly available Oracle Linux yum server, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure regional yum servers mirror all ULN channels. Thus, you can access ULN content without registering the system with ULN or using alternate tools to manage channel access, which simplifies software management on the instance.
-
-
All images have Oracle Ksplice installed by default.
-
You can run Ksplice to install patches manually or enable automatic updates to get the latest security patches without any need to reboot.
-
-
The default kernel is the latest version Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) available for the image.
-
Setting the default kernel to UEK ensures the broadest functionality support immediately after deploying an instance.
-
-
Instances can use the OCI Utilities.
-
The OCI utilities are a set of custom tools that allow the instance to access information about infrastructure resources. These tools can help automatically discover or provision resources as you need them.
-

Accessing an Instance
Connect to your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure instance using SSH.
For Oracle Linux Storage Appliance instances, connecting directly with SSH is not supported. Instead, access the instance through the web interface. See Accessing the Web Interface.
Prerequisites
Before connecting, obtain the following:
- SSH client
- Public IP address of the instance
- Path to the SSH-2 RSA private key file
Connecting Using SSH
- Complete the Prerequisites.
- From an SSH client, use the default
opcuser to connect to the instance.
For example:
ssh -i PRIVATE_KEY_PATH opc@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
- After youâ€™re logged in as
opc, you can use the
sudocommand to run administrative tasks.
For example, run the following command to show details for all storage devices attached to your instance:
sudo oci-iscsi-config --show
For more information, see:
Installing Software
Install software by enabling repositories from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure regional yum servers.
Unlike the publicly available Oracle Linux yum server, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure regional yum servers mirror all ULN channels. Therefore, compute instances can access ULN content without having to register the system with ULN. For more information, see Oracle Linux 7: Managing Software and Oracle Linux 8: Managing Software.
Connecting to the Regional Yum Server
Instances connected to the service gateway automatically have access to the regional
yum servers. The
$ociregion and
$ocidomain yum variables
determine which regional server the instance connects to.
For example, the
baseurl to the
_latest repository for
Oracle Linux 8 is:
baseurl=https://yum$ociregion.$ocidomain/repo/OracleLinux/OL8/baseos/latest/$basearch/
-
Set the
$ociregionvariable by populating content in
/etc/yum/vars/ociregion.
If the
ociregionfile does not exist or is empty, the
baseurlpoints to the publicly accessible Oracle Linux yum server. Typically, when you create the instance the
$ociregionvariable is set to point to the closest regional yum server on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service network. For example, if
$ociregionis set to
-phx, the
baseurlexpands to point to the regional yum server in Phoenix.
- Set the
$ocidomainvariable by populating content in
/etc/yum/vars/ocidomain.
Accessing ULN Content
To access ULN content on the regional yum servers, install the appropriate
release-el packages and enable the repositories that you require access to.
x
For example, on Oracle Linux 8, you can run the following commands to access the
ol8_oci_included repository, where tools like Oracle InstantClient, the Oracle Java Development Kit and Oracle Java Runtime Environment are located:
sudo dnf install oci-included-release-el8 sudo dnf config-manager --enable ol8_oci_included
Other ULN channels are also available directly through the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure regional yum servers. For example, to access the Ksplice channels on an Oracle Linux 7 compute instance, you can do:
sudo yum install ksplice-release-el7 sudo yum-config-manager --enablerepo ol7_ksplice ol7_x86_64_userspace_ksplice
Most of these channels are installed and available by default in the latest platform images.
Using OS Management
You can use OS Management to manage packages on Oracle Linux instances, including installing, removing, and updating packages. See Managing Linux Packages for more information.
OS Management uses software sources to provide packages to instances, and to track the available updates to those packages. A software source is a collection of packages. Software sources enable you to control which packages can be installed on instances without having to manually log in and configure the repositories on each instance. See Managing Software Sources for more information.
Updating an Instance
Use Oracle Ksplice, OS Management, or Oracle Autonomous Linux to help automate system updates, but also follow recommended guidance to keep your system up to date.
Using Oracle Ksplice
You can use Oracle Ksplice to patch a system without requiring a reboot. However, these updates only occur in-memory. You must also update packages on-disk to their latest versions, so that when the system reboots, it starts from the most current release. Follow the recommendations in Maintaining the System.
Using OS Management
You can use OS Management to manage and monitor updates for the OS environments Oracle Linux instances. OS Management allows you to group instances for updates, providing automated patch and fleet management capabilities. See Managing Linux Packages for more information.
Using Autonomous Linux
Oracle Autonomous Linux can automatically handle system package updates on a regular schedule. Autonomous Linux provides automatic daily updates in addition to the zero-downtime Ksplice updates for kernel, OpenSSL, and glibc libraries. These updates are referred to as autonomous updates. When you create an Autonomous Linux instance, the service automatically creates a controlled scheduled job for autonomous updates. You can update the start time for the daily autonomous updates using the Console, CLI, or API.
Maintaining the System
Regularly update the operating system and user space packages to obtain the latest bug fixes and security patches.
Oracle recommends that you:
-
Subscribe the instance to the
_latestyum repository for your Oracle Linux release.
-
Update any software that was installed outside of the Oracle Linux yum package manager.
For example, tools such as
flatpakand
snap, for installing desktop applications; and
pip,
gemand
npm, for installing Python, Ruby and Node libraries and modules, all have their own software update mechanisms.
-
Always update instances to the most recent release of the operating system.
Oracle Linux uses a rolling update level approach for keeping software up to date. For example, Oracle Linux 8.4 or Oracle Linux 8 Update 4, are rolling snapshots of the latest supported packages for the Oracle Linux release and are not considered independent versions of Oracle Linux.
-
Manually update packages or install and configure the appropriate tool for automatic updates.
- For Oracle Linux 7 instances you can use the
yum-cronutility described in Oracle Linux 7: Managing Software.
- For Oracle Linux 8 instances you can use the
dnf-automaticutility described in Oracle Linux 8: Managing Software on Oracle Linux
- For Oracle Linux 7 instances you can use the
Adding Users and Groups
Use the default
opc user to add users and groups to a newly created instance.
Oracle recommends that you create and configure users and groups according to your access requirements. Access the instance as the
opc user (see Accessing an Instance), and then add users and groups as necessary. See Create users and groups on Oracle Linux for a general introduction to users and groups on Oracle Linux.
What is the opc user?
Oracle Linux instances have a default
opc user. Use this account to create and configure additional users and groups.
The
opc account has:
- Full
sudoprivileges.
-
No password configured.
Instead you access the account over SSH with a key pair configured when you create the instance (see Accessing an Instance).
Adding a User
To add a user named
alice to the system:
sudo useradd alice
To set a password for the user:
sudo passwd alice
Adding a Group
To add a group called
staff to the system:
sudo groupadd staff
To add the user
alice to the group
staff:
sudo usermod -G staff alice
Manage the users in a group using the
groupmems command. For example, to remove
alice from the group
staff:
sudo groupmems -d alice -g staff
Configuring Permissions
Define permissions by configuring users and groups within
/etc/sudoers.
By default, members of the
wheel group can use sudo to obtain all root privileges. You can add entries for users or groups by adding files to
/etc/sudoers.d. For example, the privileges assigned to the
opc user are defined in
/etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users.
Migrating to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
You can migrate on-premises Oracle Linux images to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with the
oci-image-migrate utilities. See OCI Image Migrate Utilities.
