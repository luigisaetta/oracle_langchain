Overview of Generative AI Service
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Generative AI is a fully managed service that provides a set of state-of-the-art, customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover a wide range of use cases for text generation.
Use the playground to try out the ready-to-use pretrained models, or create and host your own fine-tuned custom models based on your own data on dedicated AI clusters.
The OCI Generative AI service includes the following foundational models:
- Generation
- Give instructions to generate text or extract information from your text.
- Summarization
- Summarize text with your instructed format, length, and tone.
- Embedding
- Convert text to vector embeddings to use in applications for semantic searches, recommender systems, text classification, or text clustering.
Using the Pretrained Foundational Models
Fine-tuning the Pretrained Models
You can create a copy of a pretrained foundational model, add your own training dataset, and let the OCI Generative AI service fine-tune the model for you. OCI Generative AI uses dedicated AI clusters specially sized for fine-tuning. These clusters belong only to your tenancy. After your model is fine-tuned, you create an endpoint for the custom model and host that model on a dedicated AI cluster that’s designed for hosting. When you create the hosting cluster, select the correct pretrained model from which the fine-tuned model is derived from.
Use Cases
Use the OCI Generative AI service for the following types of use cases.
- Text Generation
-
Create text for any purpose, for example:
- Pitch for a new product
- Slogan for a marketing campaign
- Sales email to a client
- Social media post
- Job description
- Title for an article
- Conversation
-
Create a chatbot-style user interface for intelligent interactions, for example, in customer-support scenarios. Ask questions in natural language about text submitted to the LLM—such as documents, emails, and product reviews—and the LLM reasons over the text and provides intelligent answers.
- Data Extraction
-
Extract specific pieces of data from text, for example:
- Extract applicant information from an application written in free-form text.
- Extract dates or sums from a contract.
- Extract insights or trends from data tables.
- Summarization
-
Generate executive summaries for documents that are too long to read, or summarize any type of text, for example:
- Documents
- Contracts
- Emails
- Articles
- Blog posts
- Product reviews
- Social media posts
- Classification
-
Classify text into predefined categories, for example:
- Given a list of support tickets, classify them by the department that should handle them.
- Given a list of sectors and company names, classify the companies by their respective sectors.
- Style Transfer
-
Change the style or tone of text, for example:
- Rewrite any text in a different style, format (list or paragraphs), or tone.
- Rephrase text.
- Suggest grammatical improvements.
- Semantic Similarity
-
Evaluate several inputs based on how similar their meaning is, for example:
- Evaluate a list of questions sent to a support system to extract the most relevant answer given to similar questions in the past when a new question comes in.
- Replace keyword-based searches with semantic searches to improve search results relevance.
Regions with Generative AI
Oracle hosts its OCI services in regions and availability domains. A region is a localized geographic area, and an availability domain is one or more data centers in that region. OCI Generative AI is hosted in the following region:
- Region name: US Midwest (Chicago)
- Region identifier: us-chicago-1
See About Regions and Availability Domains for the list of available OCI regions, along with associated locations, region identifiers, region keys, and availability domains.
Accessing Generative AI in the Console
- Sign in to the Console by using a supported browser.
- In the navigation bar of the Console, choose a region that hosts Generative AI, for example, US Midwest (Chicago). If you don't know which region to choose, see Regions with Generative AI.
- Open the navigation menu and click Analytics & AI. Under AI Services, click Generative AI.
