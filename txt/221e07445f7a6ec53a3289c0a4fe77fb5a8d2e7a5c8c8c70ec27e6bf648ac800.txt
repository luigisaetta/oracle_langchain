Get Started with Administration
Let’s explore Oracle Analytics Cloud and what you need to know to get started with deployment and administration on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen 2.
About Oracle Analytics Cloud on Gen 2
Oracle Analytics Cloud is a scalable and secure public cloud service that provides capabilities to explore and perform collaborative analytics for you, your workgroup, and your enterprise.
Oracle Analytics Cloud is available on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen 2 in several regions in North America, EMEA, APAC, and LAD when you subscribe through Universal Credits. You can subscribe to Professional Edition or Enterprise Edition.
When you deploy Oracle Analytics Cloud on Gen 2, you complete some initial setup steps, and then Oracle takes care of most service management, patching, backup and restore, and other maintenance tasks. You determine the size of your service when you set up the service and you can increase or decrease capacity if your requirements change. Oracle Analytics Cloud offers two sizing options, you can specify the number of Oracle Compute Units (OCPUs) you want to deploy or how many people you expect to use the service.
Region Availability
Oracle Analytics Cloud is currently available on several data regions in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific (APAC), and Latin American (LAD). Thereafter, Oracle Analytics Cloud will expand to other regions.
For the latest information on availability in regions, see Data Regions for Platform and Infrastructure Services.
Service Limits
Oracle Analytics Cloud has various default limits. Whenever you create an Oracle Analytics Cloud instance or scale up, the system ensures that your request is within the bounds of your limit. The limit that applies to you depends on which edition you subscribe to: Professional Edition or Enterprise Edition.

Service Quotas
You can use quotas to determine how other users allocate Oracle Analytics Cloud resources across compartments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Whenever you create an Oracle Analytics Cloud instance or scale up, the system ensures that your request is within the bounds of the quota for that compartment.

Service Events
Actions that you perform on Oracle Analytics Cloud instances emit events.
You can define rules that trigger a specific action when an event occurs. For example, you might define a rule that sends a notification to administrators when someone deletes an instance. See Overview of Events and Get Started with Events.

Before You Begin with Oracle Analytics Cloud on Gen 2
When you order Oracle Analytics Cloud through Universal Credits, you automatically get access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen 2 and other required services.
Here’s some information about how Oracle Analytics Cloud uses other services and what you need to do if you’re setting up Oracle Analytics Cloud for the first time.
|Service
|What is it for?
|Do I need to do anything?
|Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM)
|
Compartments: You use compartments to organize resources on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
Policies: You use IAM security policies to grant permissions.
Domains: If available in your cloud account, you use identity domains to manage users and groups in your organization who will use Oracle Analytics Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console.
|
Yes.
Before you create your first Oracle Analytics Cloud instance, Oracle recommends that you set up one or more compartments in which you can deploy and secure your cloud resources.
Optionally, you can set up security policies that give other users permission to set up and manage Oracle Analytics Cloud instances. See Give Users Permissions to Manage Analytics Cloud Instances.
If identity domains are available, you can add Oracle Analytics Cloud users and groups before you create the Oracle Analytics Cloud instance or after; you can decide. See Use Identity Domains to Set Up Users and Groups for Oracle Analytics Cloud.
|Oracle Identity Cloud Service
|
If identity domains aren't available in your cloud account, you use Oracle Identity Cloud Service to manage the users and groups in your organization who will use Oracle Analytics Cloud.
In most cases, Oracle Analytics Cloud is automatically federated with the primary Oracle Identity Cloud Service instance associated with your tenancy.
|
Yes.
You can add users and groups before you create the Oracle Analytics Cloud instance or after; you can decide. See Use Oracle Identity Cloud Service to Set Up Users and Groups for Oracle Analytics Cloud.
Note: If you want to federate with a secondary Oracle Identity Cloud Service instance or your tenancy is a government region where federation isn't set up automatically, you must federate with Oracle Identity Cloud Service manually. See Federate with Oracle Identity Cloud Service Manually.
Signing In to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console
Signing into the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console differs depending on whether or not your cloud account uses identity domains.
If you are not sure if your cloud account uses identity domains, see Set Up Users.
Sign In to a Cloud Account That Uses Identity Domains
If your cloud account uses identity domains, you sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console as a user that's configured in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM).
This topic applies only to cloud accounts that use identity domains. See Set Up Users.
- Go to http://cloud.oracle.com.
- Enter your cloud account name and click Next.
- Select the Default domain.
Every cloud account includes a Default identity domain.
You can create and manage multiple identity domains in your cloud account. For example, you might want one for development and one for production. If multiple identity domains are available, select the domain you want.
