Managing Redis Clusters
OCI Cache with Redis lets you create Redis clusters for your memory-based storage solutions.
After you've created your Redis cluster, Cache with Redis handles most of the management and operations of Redis clusters, including operations such as security updates, upgrades, and resizing.
This topic covers the following Redis cluster tasks:
- Creating a cluster.
- Viewing cluster configuration details.
- Changing a cluster's name.
- Resizing a cluster's nodes.
- Resizing the memory per node for a cluster.
- Moving a cluster to a different compartment.
- Tagging a cluster.
- Deleting a cluster.
