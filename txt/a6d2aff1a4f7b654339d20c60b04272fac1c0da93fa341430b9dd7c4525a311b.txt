Personal Identifiable Information
Language detects, classifies and provides options to de-identify personal identifiable information (PII) in unstructured text.
Use Cases
- Detecting and curating private information in user feedback
-
Many organizations collect user feedback is collected through various channels such as product reviews, return requests, support tickets, and feedback forums. You can use Language PII detection service for automatic detection of PII entities to not only proactively warn, but also anonymize before storing posted feedback. Using the automatic detection of PII entities you can proactively warn users about sharing private data, and applications to implement measures such as storing masked data.
- Scanning object storage for presence of sensitive data
-
Cloud storage solutions such as OCI Object Storage are widely used by employees to store business documents in the locations either locally controlled or shared by many teams. Ensuring that such shared locations don't store private information such as employee names, demographics and payroll information requires automatic scanning of all the documents for presence of PII. The OCI Language PII model provides batch API to process many text documents at scale for processing data at scale.
