Service Overview
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vision is a serverless, multi-tenant service, accessible using the Console, REST APIs, SDK, or CLI.
You can upload images to detect and classify objects in them. If you have lots of images, you can process them in batch using asynchronous API endpoints. Vision's features are thematically split between Document AI for document-centric images, and Image Analysis for object and scene-based images. Pretrained models and custom models are supported.
Image Analysis Pretrained Models
- Object detection
- Vision detects the location of objects in an image, such as a person, a car, a tree, or a dog. The output includes the bounding box coordinates for each object found.
- Image classification
- Vision categorizes scene-based features and objects in an image.
- Face detection
- Face detection lets you pass an image or a batch of images to Vision to detect faces, their locations, their features, and their visual quality.
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Vision can find and digitize text in an image.
Image Analysis Custom Models
- Custom Object Detection
- Build a model to detect the location of custom objects in an image. The output includes the bounding box coordinates for each object found.
- Custom Image Classification
- Build a model to identify objects and scene-based features in an image.
Document AI
The AnalyzeDocument and DocumentJob capabilities in Vision are moving to a new service, Document Understanding. The following features are impacted:
- Table detection
- Document classification
- Receipt key-value extraction
- Document OCR
- Pretrained models
-
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Vision can detect and recognize text in a document.
- Document classification: Vision can classify a document, for example, whether the document is a tax form, an invoice, or a receipt.
- Language classification: Vision classifies the language of a document based on its visual features.
- Table extraction: Vision extracts content in tabular format, maintaining the row and column relationships of cells.
- Key-value extraction: Vision identifies values for common fields in receipts.
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) PDF: Vision generates a searchable PDF file in your Object Storage.
Supported File Formats
Vision supports the following file types.
- JPG and PNG,files are supported for Image Analysis.
- JPG, PNG, PDF and TIFF files are supported for Document AI.

How to Access Vision
You access Vision using the Console, REST API, SDKs, or CLI.
- The OCI Console is an easy-to-use, browser-based interface. To access the Console, you must use a supported browser.
- The REST APIs provide the most functionality, but require programming expertise. API reference and endpoints provide endpoint details and links to the available API reference documents including the Artificial Intelligence Services REST API.
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides SDKs that interact with Language without the need to create a framework.
- The CLI provides both quick access and full functionality without the need for programming.
Vision is not supported in the Oracle Always Free tier.
