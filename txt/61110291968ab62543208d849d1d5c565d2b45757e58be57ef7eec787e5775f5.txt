Overview
Database Tools is a managed service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) that enables you to create connections to any Oracle or MySQL Database service in OCI that can be reused by multiple users, resources and services. The database connections can then be used with the SQL Worksheet to provide direct SQL access to those databases. Sensitive information such as passwords and Autonomous Database client credentials (wallet files) are stored securely and encrypted in your OCI vault.
Creating database connections is simple using the guided database connection builder user interface. Select the OCI database type (Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Database (Bare Metal, VM, Exadata), MySQL Database, and Oracle Exadata on Oracle Public Cloud) and the innovative connection build automatically discovers databases you have access to and assists in creating the connection. Database credentials are stored in the OCI vault and retrieved only when accessing the database. If the credentials change, you can quickly and easily update them in the vault, minimizing any interruptions.
The SQL Worksheet allows you to interact with any Database Tools database connection you have access to in one location. You do not need to search for connection details or use multiple web apps to access different databases. You use a single select list on the SQL Worksheet.
