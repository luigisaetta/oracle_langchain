Using the Playground
The playground is an interface in the OCI Console for exploring the hosted pretrained and custom models without writing a single line of code. Use the playground to test your use cases and refine prompts and parameters. When you're happy with the results, integrate the generated code into your applications.
Choose from one of the following models:
- Generation models: Run prompts to generate or classify text or extract information from text.
- Summarization models: Use as an executive summary generator for documents that are too long to read and summarize any type of text into free-form paragraphs or in bullet points and optionally specify the tone.
- Embedding models: Provide sentences and phrases and have the model group those sentences based on their meaning. Then use the generated embeddings in applications.
